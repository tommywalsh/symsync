This is a simple tool that allows you to create subsets of a 
particular disk area.  It uses symbolic links to minimize disk
usage.

A simple directory tree GUI is presented, and the user may check
or uncheck any file or directory.  Checking creates a symlink in 
the sync area; unchecking removes the symlink. 

An example use would be when you have an extensive music library
and want also to have a disk area for your favorites.  Pick your 
favorite bands, albums, songs, and "sync" them.  Because symlinks
are used, disk usage is minimal.  Point your music player at either
disk area, depending on your mood.
